// The company logo, additional information and URL are all optional.

// This is to fix URL problems when using a proxy in the environment.
// If links inside MRBS appear broken, then specify here the URL of

// $url_base =  "http://webtools.uab.ericsson.se/oam";

// notifications, to ensure that the correct URL is displayed in the

/*******************
 * Themes
 *******************/

// Choose a theme for the MRBS.   The theme controls two aspects of the look and feel:
//   (a) the styling:  the most commonly changed colours, dimensions and fonts have been 
//       extracted from the main CSS file and put into the styling.inc file in the appropriate
//       directory in the Themes directory.   If you want to change the colour scheme, you should
//       be able to do it by changing the values in the theme file.    More advanced styling changes
//       can be made by changing the rules in the CSS file.
//   (b) the header:  the header.inc file which contains the function used for producing the header.
//       This enables organisations to plug in their own header functions quite easily, in cases where
//       the desired corporate look and feel cannot be changed using the CSS alone and the mark-up
//       itself needs to be changed.
//
//  MRBS will look for the files "styling.inc" and "header.inc" in the directory Themes/$theme and
//  if it can't find them will use the files in Themes/default.    A theme directory can contain
//  a replacement styling.inc file or a replacement header.inc file or both.

// Available options are:

// "default"        Default MRBS theme
// "classic126"     Same colour scheme as MRBS 1.2.6
// "theharbour"     Custom theme created for The Harbour

$theme = "theharbour";
